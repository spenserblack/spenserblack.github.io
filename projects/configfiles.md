## [configfiles](https://github.com/spenserblack/configfiles)

This is a tool that I made because, honestly, creating the same configuration
files over and over was getting annoying. There are ways to solve this, like
template repositories, but I wanted something that was portable to multiple
projects, and didn't require a template. So this project is a collection of
configuration files for various types of projects. For example, it provides
[`.gitignore` and `.gitattributes` files for Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/qa#which-files-should-be-gitignored),
or a [`.flake8` file](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) that is compatible
with the [Python code formatter Black](https://github.com/psf/black).

It comes with a CLI to simplify choosing which files to set up.
