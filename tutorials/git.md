## Git

The stuff you should know (but they probably didn't teach you).

### Refresher

If you learned Git, you know `git add` and `git commit`. `git add` stages
changes, and `git commit`... commits changes. What does this mean? Here is
another way to put it: `git add` tells git "here are the changes I like," and
`git commit` says "I'm done telling you which changes I like, now save them!"

### Making *Good* Commits

First step: if you learned that the Git workflow is `git add .` and
`git commit -m "Did a thing"`, unlearn it. Forming a habit of using `git add`
and `git commit` like this is a beginner's trap that results in a messy git
history.

#### Making Sure Your History Is Clean

Here is a good general rule: 1 useful change for 1 commit. Why? It makes the
history more useful. Here's a basic example: what if your history looked like
this?

```console
$ git log --oneline
aaaaaaaa Add cool feature and fix bug
```

Now what if that "cool feature" wasn't so cool after all? What if you wanted to
undo it? You could use `git revert aaaaaaaa`, but then you would lose the bug
fix.

But what if your history looked like this?

```console
$ git log --oneline
bbbbbbbb Fix bug
aaaaaaaa Add cool feature
```

Now `git revert aaaaaaaa` is no problem! The bug fix is kept when you revert
the "Add cool feature" commit.

For keeping a clean history, `git add --patch` is the best command that nobody
uses. What does it do? Normally, `git add [path]` stages *all* changes in
files. `git add --patch` (`git add -p` for short) lets you review the changes
in each file, and *pick which changes to add and which to ignore.* This is not
only an incrediblyuseful way to avoid staging/committing unrelated changes.
Also, if you're not 100% sure what's staged before a commit, run `git status`
or `git diff --staged` to double-check that everything looks good.

#### Writing Good Commit Messages

If you only use `git commit -m "Changes"`, then you've written commits with
subject lines. But did you know that, like an email a commit message can have
both a subject and a body? The *correct* way to write a good commit message
would be to just execute `git commit` (no `-m`), and let git open a text editor.
You may want to use `git config --global core.editor <editor command>` to use
your favorite text editor for commits. So if that's the correct way, what's the
other way? `-m` can actually be passed multiple times to `git commit`, like so:
`git commit -m "subject" -m "detailed explanation of changes"`. So why isn't this
the correct way? Simple: it's easier to format text to be pretty in a text editor
than in the command line. ðŸ˜†

### `git bisect`

This is an awesome command that is sorely underused. It lets you *identify the
commit that introduced a bug.* What it does is let you mark an earlier commit
as "good" and a recent commit as "bad." It will then jump between the halfway
point of the "good" and "bad" commit, ask you if the currently checked-out
commit is good or bad, then continue the previous step until a single commit
is identified as the bad commit.

Here is an example of using `git bisect`.

```shell
# Something is failing! But it wasn't failing before... ðŸ¤”
git bisect start
git bisect bad
git checkout HEAD~20 # Jump 20 commits backwards
# Check if the bug still exists. No bug? Then this is a good commit!
git bisect good
# Now git will checkout a commit and ask you if it's good or bad.
# Keep marking commits as either good or bad and eventually...
# Commit <sha> identified as the first bad commit
```

Now, if you have a *clean* history, identifying the bad commit
allows you to check the diff with `git show <sha>`. Viewing the diff
can make it very easy to see what change introduced the bug, which
makes it much easier to identify what to do to fix the bug.
